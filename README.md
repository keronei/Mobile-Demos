### DESCRIPTION

There are multiple families of numbers, such as the natural numbers, rational numbers, complex numbers, but in Numberland, the most important families are of the even and odd numbers.


At the family reunion organized by Zero, a close friend of both the families, the first E even numbers and the first O odd numbers decide to arrive.


At the event, each member of the odd family wants to take all possible pictures with all the younger members of the even family and vice versa.

2. The age of a number is it's numerical value i.e..,

   the age of four is 4, the age of five is 5.


Input

The input consists of 2 numbers, E O


Output

The total number of photos taken during the meeting


Constraints

1 ≤ E, O ≤ 51


Sample Test Cases


Input

2 3


Output

8


Explanation

Here, we have the first 2 even numbers:

2 4


And the first 3 odd numbers

1 3 5


The possible photos that 5 can take are:

{5 2}, {5 4}, {5 2 4}


Similarly, the possible photos that can be taken are:

Photos 5 can take: {5 4} {5 2} {5 4 2}

Photos 3 can take: {3 2}

Photos 4 can take: {4 3} {4 1} {4 3 1}

Photos 2 can take: {2 1}

which is a total of 8 photos.
